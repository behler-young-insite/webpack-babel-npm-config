    npm init -y
    npm i -d webpack webpack-cli
        change in package.json
            scripts to include "build": "webpack"
            make src folder in rootdir
            make index.js in src folder
            npm run build --> makes a dist folder with main.js in it (transpiled from index.js)
    npm i -d html-webpack-plugin html-loader // allows you to transpile html from src dir
        create webpack.config.js and fill it out (require the plugin, define rules, options, plugins, template (index.html location), filename - new name in dist folder, gets transpiled with js on build)
    npm i -d webpack-dev-server // saves hastle of turning on/off server on change, triggers rebuilds on the fly
        add dev script to package.json "dev": "webpack-dev-server" // opens local live server for testing
    npm i -D babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-env
        add babel-loader to webpack.config.js rules
    npm i -d file-loader // to transpile specified assets, e.g. src/assets/img.jpg --> dist/2934t2r39fnsidf9a8f.jpg)
        add another rule to webpack.config.js
    npm i -D node-sass style-loader css-loader sass-loader mini-css-extract-plugin // enables use of sass
        import your styles to your index.js - also a good idea to write your js code on other files and import them to your index.js - styles will be compiled with js now.
        add MiniCssExtractPlugin to your webpack.config.js

    npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader tslint tslint-webpack-plugin
        tslint --init // initializes tslint, creates tslint.json file, this command only works if you have tslint installed globally, otherwise you need to specify pathing

    finding out that with my added configs, it looks like my previous src/index.js isn't being automatically included on the index.html
        fixed by changing entrypoint on webpack.config to be the src directory (it was previously targeting src/bundle.ts), not it targets all js and ts in src dir
            didn't fix it, now the ts code isn't included
